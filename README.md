# Movie Recommendation Engine - InfoSeekers

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation engine using collaborative filtering techniques. The aim is to improve user experiences by offering personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and interactions.

## Objectives
- Implement a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering.
- Improve movie recommendation precision through pivot-based similarity calculations.

## Key Features
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user interactions.
- Dynamic refinement of recommendations as users engage with the system.
- Efficient pivot-based similarity calculations for improved performance.

## Methodology
### 1. **Recommendation Algorithm**
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Identify users with similar preferences and generate recommendations.
- **Pivot-Based Similarity Calculation:**
  - Use common sets of movies rated by multiple users as pivots.
  - Calculate similarities based on these pivots to reduce computational overhead.
  - Select neighbors with the highest similarity scores.
- **Recommendation Generation:**
  - Recommend unrated movies that are popular among similar users.

### 2. **System Architecture**
- **Data Preparation:** Collect and preprocess user-movie interaction data.
- **Feature Selection:** Include movie genres and user historical ratings.
- **KNN Model Training:** Use pivot-based similarity to identify K-nearest neighbors.
- **Recommendation Display:** Provide a ranked list of movies along with relevant information.

### 3. **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **IDE:** Google Colaboratory Notebook, VS Code
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Prepare user-item matrix for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and normalize the dataset.
3. **Model Development:** Train models using KNN with pivot-based similarity.
4. **Testing and Evaluation:** Measure the systemâ€™s precision and recall.

## Conclusion
This project successfully developed a movie recommendation engine leveraging collaborative filtering and pivot-based similarity calculations. It enhances user experience by providing accurate and personalized recommendations.
